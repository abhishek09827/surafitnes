                I would like to thank Team Sura for their hardwork, to raise my limits and keep challenging me. The diet plan was customised according to whatever was available to me. I was 116 Kgs and I reduced to 73kgs that too age of 58Yrs and the workout given were such that my skin did not sag. I think I will retire from the service with same physique, only difference will be my bald head from my younger days .

                I had gained a lot of fat during my preparation days. This affected my breathing pattern, gave me back aches as well as led to rapid hairfall. But i worked with Sura Fitness and they were progressively able to address all these issues. I thank the team for their dedication and support.

                It has been almost one year and I have lost weight and increased my strength.  I find the coaches – so motivating and supportive.  During the shred I worked with Sura sir and he was very motivating and held me accountable.  The nutritional guidance and meal plans are easy to follow that is realistic and plenty of food. Everyone is extremely – REAL – supportive, FUN, KNOWLEDGABLE and challenging.</p>

               Me and my wife both joined SuraFitness after my son's recommendation.
Doctor suggested surgery for my wife's cervical but physio and whole team worked really hard to cure my wife's cervical issue. Seeing this results I also joined for my injury I sustained during my submarines missions in elite Indian Navy. And it worked wonders,would like to give my sincere regards to the whole team. Jai Hind.</p>

                The services of Sura fitness are excellent. Staff also followups with the customer regularly to know the status of the plan whether it is being followed. I strongly recommend this for fitness consultation.</p>
